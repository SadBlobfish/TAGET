This project uses Lua, a very powerful and lightweight scripting language.
Find it at http://www.lua.org/

_NOTICE_ : This is the 'jimothy' branch, which was written by someone else
who isn't a programmer. Some of the code isn't great. This branch also
uses an older version of the master branch as a starting point.

To start :

Windows : drag 'main.lua' onto 'lua52.exe'

Linux/Mac OS X : Use your own copy of Lua (at least 5.2)
and run the 'main.lua' file
